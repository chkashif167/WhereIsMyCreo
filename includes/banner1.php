		<h1>Never. Enough.</h1>
		<p>Repeat after us. There can never be enough cheese on my nachos. Never enough chocolate chips on my cookie. Never enough guitars. Shoes. Or Saturdays in a week.</p>
		<p>And never. Ever. Ever (we threw in an extra for effect). Enough t-shirts in my closet.</p>
		<h1>AMEN.</h1>
		<p>Enough said. Just sign up for AED 80 per month, and get an awesome new t-shirt at your doorstep. That’s like 12 scrumptious dishes at a blind tasting at your favorite restaurant. Umm, why blind? Oh we pick the design – and you’ll love it!</p>
