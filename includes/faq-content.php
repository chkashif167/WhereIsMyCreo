<h1>WHAT FABRIC DO YOU USE?</h1>
<p>CREO t-shirts are ‘100% Awesome’. Wait, did we say awesome? We meant cotton.</p>

<h1>IF I ORDER THE WRONG SIZE, WHAT DO I DO?</h1>
<p>We don’t want you to get stuck with the wrong size. That’s why CREO has a stretchy and flexible exchange/return policy for its t-shirts. Simply contact us at <a href="mailto:talktous@creoroom.com">talktous@creoroom.com</a> and we’ll take it from there.</p>

<h1>CAN I SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE THAN ONE T-SHIRT A MONTH?</h1>
<p>Like we said, there can never be enough t-shirts in your closet and one can never have enough surprises in the mail. Except for bills, of course.</p><p>Just sign up for as many pay ‘Monthly’ subscriptions you want and keep a look out for the multiple awesomeness coming your way. Oh and don’t worry, we won’t send you the same print twice.
</p>

<h1>ARE ALL YOUR DESIGNS GENDER SPECIFIC?</h1>
<p>Oh no. We know that not all men and women have the same style, interests, sense of humor or favorite ice cream flavor. However, we do have a few collections that can be easily worn by both. So don’t be surprised if your brother or man-best-friend ends up with the same t-shirt as you.</p>

<h1>HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR MY T-SHIRT TO ARRIVE?</h1>
<p>If you live in the UAE, your t-shirt will be at your doorstep within 6-8 days from the day of your first subscription. If you live outside of the UAE, contact our friendly customer service person for more details on international delivery schedules.</p>
